# Setup script

## Overview

This repository includes my personal setup script for most of the terminal based configuration needed on a fresh Linux Mint installation.

## Dependencies

I generally try to minimize dependencies, but I'm a one man crew and can therefore only support Debian-based Linux distributions as I'm running one myself. Anyway, you need to have the following packages installed for everything to work properly:

- Everything needed is already preinstalled on modern Linux Mint versions.

## How to use it

Simply make the `setup.sh` script executable via `chmod +x ./setup.sh` and execute it via `./setup.sh`. Then tweak some more settings using the GUI to your liking and you should be ready to go.
